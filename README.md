Overview

This repository contains various projects that showcase my programming skills and experience. Below there is a Blackjack project that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, also there is a card deck simulator that demonstrates front-end development using React.

Projects

1. Blackjack - TypeScript Implementation

Description

This is a command-line Blackjack game implemented in TypeScript. The project focuses on object-oriented design, featuring cleasses for game components such as Deck, Card, Player, and Dealer. The game allows a user to play against an AI dealer while following the standard fules of Blackjack.

Features

* Implements core Blackjack rules.
* AI dealer logic that follows a strict set of rules.
* Object-oriented design with reusable components.
* Console-based user interaction for a simple gameplay experience.

Installation & Usage 

Navigate to the README in the blackjack-ts folder to see how to run the project.


2. Card Deck Simulator - React & TypeScript Implementation

Description

This is a web-based Card Deck Simulator built using React and TypeScript. The project allows users to shuffle a standard 52-card deck, draw random cards, and view the remaining card count. The application follows component-based design principles, utilizing React functional components and state management to create an interactive experience.

Features

* Dynamically generates a full deck of 52 playing cards.
* Allows users to shuffle the deck randomly.
* Provides functionality to draw a card from the deck.
* Displays drawn cards in a separate area.
* Shows the total number of remaining cards in the deck.
* Built using React components for modularity and reusability.

Installation & Usage
